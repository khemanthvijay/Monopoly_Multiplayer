# Monopoly Multiplayer  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project is a **real-time multiplayer Monopoly game** implemented with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **WebSockets**. It features robust gameplay with room management, player interactions, and seamless real-time communication. Designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, the game logic is modular and easy to scale.  

Future developments include integrating an **AI player** to enhance gameplay dynamics and challenge human players.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Server**:  
  - Express.js for HTTP handling  
  - WebSockets for real-time communication  
- **Frontend**:  
  - WebSockets for real-time interaction  
  - JavaScript for dynamic gameplay  
- **Programming Concepts**:  
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
  - Arrays, lists, and advanced JavaScript  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Room Management**:  
  - Players can create rooms to initialize WebSocket connections and invite others to join.  
  - Rooms dynamically manage player interactions and game progress.  

- **Real-Time Gameplay**:  
  - Implements advanced JavaScript libraries and techniques to deliver a smooth and engaging game experience.  
  - Node.js ensures robust performance for simultaneous players.  

- **Modular Design**:  
  - OOP principles streamline handling players, rooms, and the main game logic.  
  - Easily scalable for future enhancements, including AI integration.  

## 🔨 Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khemanthvijay/Monopoly_Multiplayer.git
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
    npm install
3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
## 🎮 How It Works
- Players create a game room, which initializes WebSocket connections.
- The server dynamically manages player data, room states, and game progress.
- Real-time updates ensure seamless gameplay across all connected players.
## 🏆 Future Improvements
- AI Integration: Incorporate an AI player to simulate realistic and challenging opponents.
- Enhanced UI/UX: Improve the web interface for a more engaging user experience.
- Mobile Support: Optimize gameplay for mobile devices.
